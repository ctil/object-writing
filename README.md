# What is object writing?
Object writing is tool for songwriters developed by Pat Pattison and described in his book [*Writing Better Lyrics*](http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Better-Lyrics-Pat-Pattison-ebook/dp/B008Y0XH1C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1422829252&sr=8-1&keywords=writing+better+lyrics).  It involves writing about an object or subject using your senses, with the goal of loosening up the creative flow.
